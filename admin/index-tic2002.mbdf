# Module overview
<div class="indented" id="module-info">

<img src="{{baseUrl}}/images/growingPlant.png" width="700">

_TIC2002 Introduction to Software Engineering_ contains roughly a **50-50 balance of theory and practice** of SE. It covers the knowledge/skills necessary to do small software projects, and as such, it is **a first step towards preparing you to work in bigger SE projects**, which will be done in later modules.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**This module is optimized for SCALE students**{.text-success} so that you can _learn at your own pace_ even if you are not a full-time student: the need to attend lectures/tutorials at fixed times is low, deadlines are more flexible than usual, and the on-campus presence is optional.

e.g., **Instead of traditional instructor-led tutorials**, the module provides quizzes and other activities that you can do at your own time to self-test your knowledge. The instructor can be consulted if you need help with any of them.

# Lectures + Tutorials
<div class="indented" id="lectures-info">

%%:far-clock:%% Wednesdays 6.30-9.30pm<br>
%%:fas-map-marker-alt:%% Online + (optional: COM1-02-06)<br>

**A TIC2002 lecture + tutorial time is divided into three parts**, as follows:

* **[6.30-7.00pm] Pre-lecture consultations:**
  * You can use this time to get prof's help if you encountered problems while doing the previous week's tasks.
  * This session will be online. Communications with the prof is to be done using Microsoft Teams app.
    * If the question is is potentially relevant to others in the class, post your question in the chat room of the `TIC2002-{{ period }}` ([link]({{ url_ms_teams_class }})) MS Team.
    * Otherwise search for prof's name (`Damith Chatura RAJAPAKSE`) in MS Teams and send a private chat message.
* **[7.00-8.00pm] Lecture briefing**:
  * Will be done via Zoom.
  * You are encouraged to attend the Zoom session as there could be in-lecture activities. But a recording will be made available in case you can't attend the live Zoom session.
* **[8.00-9.30pm] Post-lecture consultations**:
  * This portion will start as soon as the previous portion  (i.e., the _lecture briefing_ on Zoom) ends.
  * During this time,
    * go through the week's lecture topics in the module website
    * do suggested activities/exercises in there (if any)
    * if you encounter any problems while doing the above or have a question, contact the prof using MS-Teams, similar to the _pre-lecture consultations_ explained above.<br>
      {{ icon_tip }} ==If you prefer face-to-face interactions during this portion==, I can come to meet you f2f in LT19 (it's just a short walk from my office where I'll be doing the Zoom lecture).

**Lecture slides are not suitable to be used as reference materials** as they have been <tooltip content="i.e., heavy use of graphics and animations">optimized for lecture delivery</tooltip> instead. Use the textbook (not slides) as your main reference. Slides can be uploaded to LumiNUS if requested, _after_ the lecture.<br>

<div class="indented">

<include src="textbooks.md#main" />

</div>

{{ line_dotted }}<!-- ................................................................................... -->

# Programming language
<div class="indented" id="java">

This module uses Java. It assumes you are familiar with C++ basics and provides lessons to help you transition from C++ to Java.

{{ icon_important_big_red }} Install [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html) on your computer. Using other versions of Java is highly discouraged.

</div>

{{ line_dotted }}<!-- ................................................................................... -->

# Programming exercises
<div id="exercises-info" class="indented">

In some weeks, there will be some programming exercises for you to submit (on Coursemology). You should do the exercises as you learn the topics.


<box type="warning" seamless>

==**Focus on learning the topic rather than finishing the exercises.**== While these are exercises provided to self-test your knowledge, the more important thing is to read and understand the topic content. Furthermore, not all topics are tested by exercises.
</box>

{{ icon_important_big_red }} Programming exercises are graded for participation.

# Project
<div class="indented">

<div  id="project-info">

* The project is to be done **individually**.
* The project based on a [generic project called Duke](../se-book-adapted/projectDuke/index.html).
* In the project, you will build a small chatbot, using Java.
* The project is to be done in small increments. You will be given a schedule of what increments to be done in each week.
* Some weekly increments will be common to all students, while some will vary from student to student. That means your final product will be unique in terms of total features, but some features will be common to other students in the class.

</div>

Weekly project increments are given in the panels below:
<div class="indented">
{% for i in range(3, 14) %}
<panel header="**Week {{ i }}**">
<include src="../schedule/week{{ i }}/admin-tic2002.mbdf#project" />
</panel>
{% endfor %}
</div>
<p/>
<div id="final-submission-info">

### Week 13: Final submission

**Deadline**:
* Soft deadline (for the project report): {{ get_date(date_w13_start, format=format_normal) }} (Monday of week 13)<br>
  Hard deadline (for all submissions): {{ get_date(date_w13_start, 6, format=format_normal) }} (Sunday of week 13)<br>
  An extra week can be given (upon request) for a small late submission penalty of `-2` marks.

* What's the difference between the soft deadline and the hard deadline? You can get prof's feedback on a draft of the project report up to the soft deadline. Note that feedback on project report draft will be high-level feedback only (reason: the report is graded). To receive feedback, email a draft of the report to the prof before the soft deadline.

* Submissions later than the hard deadline are liable to a late submission penalty, to be fair to those who submitted on time. But given you are part-time students, late submission penalty will be more lenient than otherwise (e.g., `-1 per day`) and will be on a case-by-case basis.

**Deliverables**:

<box type="important" seamless>

Please upload items 2, 3, 4 as three separate files. ==Do not put them into a single zip file==.
</box>

1. **Source code** of the working program: push to your GitHub repo
1. **Product**: Create a JAR file for the final version of the code and submit to LumiNUS, name: `{YourName}.jar` e.g., `JunHao.jar`
1. **Documentation**: a single .docx (preferred) or a pdf file that follows the template file given (available in LumiNUS/Files/Handouts).<br>
   Submission: Upload to LumiNUS. The file name should be your name e.g., `JunHao.docx`
1. **Demo video**:
   * Record a demo video showcasing the features of your product.
   * Use the exact version of the code you submitted (i.e., the demo should match the submitted code exactly).
   * Recommended length 7 minutes, max length 10 minutes.
   * Audio narration is optional if the demo can be understood without the audio.
   * Ensure the video is in a format that can be played by any computer.
   * Submission: Name the file with your name (to match the jar and the report file) and upload to LumiNUS.

# Policies

<span id="deadlines-info">

### Deadlines
* Deadline for weekly tasks:
  * **If a specific deadline is given**, adhere to that.
  * **If no specific deadline is given**, try to complete tasks allocated to a week by Tuesday 6.30pm of the following week (i.e., before the next lecture). In case you fail to meet that deadline, you should still do those tasks as soon as possible. There will be no penalty if a task is done within a _grace period_ of one week after the deadline.

### Plagiarism

* You are allowed (and even encouraged) to discuss module tasks with others and help (and learn-from) each other. However, the submitted work should be your own.

# Assessment
<div class="indented">

****[{{ 100 - (marks_exam | int) }}%] CA****
* **{{ marks_participation }}%: Participation** -- Each week has activities that can earn you participation points.<br>
  For you to be considered as _participated_ in a particular week, you need to earn at least half of available participation points in that week (e.g., if the eligible activities in a week offer a total of `5` points, you should earn at least `3` points).<br>
  To earn full {{ marks_participation }}% marks allocated for participation, you should have _participated_ (based on the above criterion) in at least 10 (out of 13) weeks.<br>
  You can track your participation points through the [Participation Dashboard]({{ url_participation_dashboard }}).<br>
  Given below are the typical activities that can earn you participation points:
  * **Weekly quizzes**:
    * When awarding participation points for quizzes, we look for two conditions:
      * Condition 1: submitted **_early_** i.e., before the next lecture
      * Condition 2: answered **_correctly_** i.e., least 70% of the answers are correct %%(reason: to discourage random answers)%%
    * You earn:
      * 3 points if you satisfy both conditions.
      * 2 points if only one of the conditions is satisfied.
      * 1 point if submitted but both conditions are not satisfied.
  * **Weekly programming exercises**: You can earn `3` points if you complete at least 80% of the exercises allocated for that week.
  * **Other admin activities**: Other admin activities such as submitting a survey can earn you `2` points, unless the activity specify a different number of points.
* **[{{ marks_ip }}%] Project**
  * **[{{ marks_ip_implementation }}%]** Features, code
  * **[{{ marks_ip_documentation }}%]** Documentation

****[{{ marks_exam }}%] Final Exam****
