{{ icon_important_big_red }} We strongly recommend you to **have a team project meeting _before_ the tutorial**. Keep notes of the meeting, and update project documents -- the tutor will ask for those during the tutorial.

* **Help each other finish iP tasks.** Tasks allocated to this week are especially troublesome and some peer help can be very useful.<br>

On a separate note, our guidelines on dealing with technical problems:
